CNC + Fiber Laser PCB 

![Screenshot](pics/engraved.jpeg)

You can make a PCB with a CNC.
You can make a PCB with a Fiber Laser.

CNCs are excellent for making deep cuts and drilling holes.
Fiber Lasers excel at making fine pitch traces quickly. 

Let the CNC handle the edge cuts, vias and mounting holes. 
Let the laser cut and engrave nearly perfect traces. 

You might be thinking. That is a lot of $$$. Why not use one? Time. The laser produces a lot of fumes and is pretty takes 3x as long for Edge Cuts.
The CNC consumes fine tipped bits, requires alignment and takes nearly 3x the time to mill out traces.

By using the appropriate technology you save time. You now have two tools that can run simultaniously to speed up your in house rapid prototyping workshop.
